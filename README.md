# AIStoryGenerator
Leverage Generative AI to Create Engaging Stories Instantly

# About the Project
The AI Story Generator is a web application designed to assist writers, educators, and content creators by generating custom stories in real-time. Built with Flask (backend) and HTML/CSS (frontend), it integrates Cohere's generative AI model to craft contextually relevant and grammatically sound narratives based on user-defined genres, characters, settings, and key events.
